# Payment and Escrow System for Play ChaCha

## Overview

This document outlines the payment and escrow system for Play ChaCha, a peer-to-peer sports betting platform. The system is designed to handle secure transactions between users, manage escrow functionality for bets, and process automatic payouts to winners.

## Key Components

1. **Payment Processing**: Integration with payment gateways to handle deposits and withdrawals
2. **Escrow System**: Secure holding of funds during active bets
3. **Automatic Payout**: Distribution of winnings based on event outcomes
4. **Platform Fee Calculation**: Implementation of the 3% platform fee
5. **Transaction History**: Comprehensive record-keeping of all financial transactions
6. **Security Measures**: Protection against fraud and unauthorized access

## Payment Gateway Selection

After researching various payment gateway options, we have selected **Stripe Connect** as our primary payment processor for the following reasons:

1. **Platform/Marketplace Focus**: Stripe Connect is specifically designed for platforms that facilitate transactions between users, making it ideal for our peer-to-peer betting model.

2. **Escrow Functionality**: Stripe Connect allows us to hold funds in escrow until specific conditions are met, which is essential for our betting platform.

3. **Global Reach**: Supports 135+ currencies and 40+ payment methods, enabling us to serve users worldwide.

4. **Customizable Fee Structure**: Allows us to implement our 3% platform fee model easily.

5. **Robust Security**: Provides industry-leading security features and compliance with financial regulations.

6. **Comprehensive API**: Offers a well-documented API that integrates seamlessly with our backend.

7. **User Experience**: Provides a smooth onboarding process and intuitive payment flows for users.

## Escrow System Design

The escrow system is a critical component of Play ChaCha, ensuring fair play and trust between users. Here's how it works:

1. **Bet Creation**:
   - User A creates a bet on a sports event
   - User A's funds are transferred to the escrow account
   - The bet becomes available for other users to accept

2. **Bet Matching**:
   - User B accepts the bet
   - User B's funds are also transferred to the escrow account
   - The bet is locked, and neither user can cancel it

3. **Event Completion**:
   - The sports event concludes
   - The platform verifies the outcome through the sports data API
   - The winner is determined based on the bet terms

4. **Automatic Payout**:
   - The escrow system calculates the winnings (total pot minus 3% platform fee)
   - Funds are automatically transferred to the winner's wallet
   - The platform fee is collected in a separate account

5. **Dispute Resolution**:
   - In case of disputes, the platform provides a resolution mechanism
   - Funds remain in escrow until the dispute is resolved
   - Admin intervention may be required in complex cases
