# Deployment Strategy for Play ChaCha

## Overview

This document outlines the deployment strategy for the Play ChaCha peer-to-peer sports betting platform as part of the Visnec Nexus (VNX) ecosystem at visnec.ai. The strategy is designed to ensure high availability, scalability, and reliability of the platform in production.

## Deployment Architecture

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
